Thank you for purchasing this set of hand-painted sky textures.
Each texture is a 4096x2048 lat-long map, and there is a skybox material already setup for each one.

To use one of these skyboxes in your scene, first open the lighting panel by going to Window->Lighting. Next, drag one of the skybox materials over the 'Skybox' paramater under Enviroment Lighting. That's it! You should now see the skybox previewed in the scene view.
